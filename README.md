Original description by Albert:

Tired of using brytewave's terrible interface? Too lazy to flip through hundreds of pages to find a single definition? Stuck on a proof because you forgot the difference between a cycle (walk) and a cycle (graph)? Not to worry! During my review, I have compiled every definition in the book into one nicely formatted and compact LaTeX doc!!

Almost every definition is word for word from the book, and I included some important implications and alternate definitions as well.
